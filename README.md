# MAI271---JAVA-Programming

**This repository contains Java projects completed during Semester 2 of my studies.**

**## About Java**

* Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language used for building various applications, from web and mobile apps to enterprise software.
* It's known for its platform independence, meaning Java code can run on different operating systems without modification.
* Key features include:
    - **Object-oriented programming (OOP):** Encapsulates data and behavior within objects, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
    - **Platform independence:** Write once, run anywhere (WORA) philosophy.
    - **Garbage collection:** Automatic memory management.
    - **Extensive libraries and frameworks:** A rich ecosystem of tools and resources.

**## Development Environment**

* **VS Code:** A popular, open-source code editor with Java support.
* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Required to compile and run Java code.
* **Extensions:** Consider using VS Code extensions for Java development, such as:
    - Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat
    - Debugger for Java
    - Maven for Java

**## Important Java Concepts**

* **Classes:** Blueprints for creating objects.
* **Objects:** Instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior.
* **Methods:** Functions that define an object's behavior.
* **Inheritance:** Allows classes to inherit properties and methods from parent classes.
* **Polymorphism:** The ability of objects to take on multiple forms.
* **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods within a single unit to protect data integrity.
